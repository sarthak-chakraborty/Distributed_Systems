# CS-425 MP1

### Setup (run on each VM):

1. `git clone https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/sc134/cs-425-mp1.git`
2. `cd cs-425-mp1`
3. Download log files and compile `server.cpp` and `client.cpp`: `bash setup_vm.sh`
4. Start the server: `./server.out i`, where `i` is the corresponding machine (VM) number

Now, start the client on any machine of your choice, say machine k. Run `./client.out k`
You will see a terminal prompt `>` where you can enter any grep commands. Enter commands in the format `grep XYZ`, **without** any quotes around the desired expression.

### For Unit Testing:
1. Repeat steps 1-4 above.
2. Copy log files to testing directory: `cp -r "MP1 Demo Data FA22" "../test/MP1 Demo Data FA22"`
3. Make sure the log files in `./test/MP1 Demo Data FA22` are for the machines that are acting as a server. If machine `1`, `2` and `3` are being used as a server, then the directory shoud only have `vm1.log`, `vm2.log` and `vm3.log`.
3. `cd test`
4. `g++ -o client_test.out client_test.cpp`
4. `./client_test.out`. The program will print out the ground truth grep output for a pattern as well as the one generated by our distributed program, and finally report whether the unit test passed or failed. The pattern that need to be search is stored in `L96`, variable `pattern`.
